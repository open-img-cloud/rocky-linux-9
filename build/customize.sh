# Customize hook called by the build-libguestfs-image reusable workflow.
# Receives the qcow2 path as $1.

# The upstream Rocky Linux 9 GenericCloud image already ships cloud-init,
# openssh-server, qemu-guest-agent, a serial console and the `rocky`
# default user. The org-wide cloud-init policy drop-in (datasource_list,
# disable_root, ssh_pwauth=false, mount_default_fields) is injected by the
# reusable workflow after this script runs. Customisation reduces to a
# package cache cleanup so the published qcow2 stays small.
